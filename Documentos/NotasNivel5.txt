The Gaitori defeat in the Demeter system effectively ended their potency near Ishiman space; now we must take the battle to them.

We traced the jumpstream from Elysium to here, the Aeneas system. We believe it's the primary base of operations for the Cantharan-loyal military.  Your mission is to occupy their base, and to rout them from the system.


La derrota de los Gaitori en el sistema Demeter efectivamente puso fin a su potencial cerca del espacio Ishiman; ahora debemos llevar la batalla a ellos.



    Rastreamos el flujo de salto desde Elysium hasta aquí, el sistema Aeneas. Creemos que es la base de operaciones principal para el ejército leal a Cantharan.

    Tu misión es ocupar su base y expulsarlos del sistema.

			
Los prisioneros Obish serán vulnerables al fuego de tus armas, ya que tus sistemas de apuntado no estarán ajustados a sus trajes. Ten cuidado de no atraparlos en el fuego cruzado. También estarán desorientados, así que dales suficiente tiempo para ingresar al transporte.
